When I found out that Zuitt was providing a free Data Virtualization Workshop about a couple of months ago, I did not hesitated to register. It was due to the fact and consideration of Zuitt's posistion as a known institution that provides quality education when it comes to getting your feet wet into programming. I believe that these free basic workshops and trainings help empower people that want to know, but has no means or simply does not know where to start, and the latter is what's keeping me to pursue this workshop, and I am thankful it exists.
