When I found out that Zuitt was providing a free Data Virtualization Workshop about a couple of months ago, I did not hesitated to register. It was due to the fact and consideration of Zuitt's posistion as a known institution that provides quality education when it comes to getting your feet wet into programming. I believe that these free basic workshops and trainings help empower people that want to know, but has no means or simply does not know where to start, and the latter is what's keeping me to pursue this workshop, and I am thankful it exists.

I had a basic background on web development, mostly frontend experience. I was freelancing workflow automation before with Google Sheets and Google Appscript, and knowing basic html and javascript was a requirement for it to run. I was also training AI and Machine Learning for embedded systems because it was an academic requirement of my ECE course, although the technologies I use were far off from Web Dev, as I use Tensorflow and C++. I am also a Linux hobbyist, as I find the operating system (Ubuntu at least) a bit easier to operate than windows, especially when I'm using it for academic purposes and hobbies like self hosting servers. Hopefully I could patch up the basic web development experience I have during this workshop, especially that I could not find the time to practice and actually learn css.
